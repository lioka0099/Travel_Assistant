- iso_start, iso_end: for a date range if provided explicitly.

Notes:
- Do NOT guess dates. Prefer 'today/tomorrow/weekend' if the user is relative.
- For parts of day (tonight/evening/morning/afternoon), MAP to the appropriate DAY:
  tonight/evening ⇒ today (destination timezone), morning/afternoon without a date ⇒ today.
- For “next weekend” or similar, choose 'weekend' (we resolve it later in destination timezone).
